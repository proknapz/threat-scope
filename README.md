## Machine Learning Model

The scanner uses a Logistic Regression classifier trained on:
- **Features**: TF-IDF vectorization with character n-grams (3-5 characters)
- **Training Data**: 8,640 safe and 912 unsafe PHP files
- **Analysis**: Line-level vulnerability detection with taint analysis
- **Performance**: 95.6% recall, 39.8% precision, 56.2% F1-score
- **Threshold**: 0.719 (optimized for maximum vulnerability detection)

## Database Schema

### Scan Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `filename`: Name of scanned file
- `timestamp`: When the scan was performed
- `results`: JSON containing detailed scan results
- `total_lines`: Total number of lines in the file
- `unsafe_lines`: Number of unsafe lines detected
- `safe_lines`: Number of safe lines
- `file_size`: File size in bytes

## Development

### Testing Detection
```bash
python scripts/detect_lines.py --file path/to/file.php --model models/logreg_model.pkl --vectorizer models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl --threshold 0.719
```

### Model Evaluation
